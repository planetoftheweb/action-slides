YAML Ain't Markup Language

# Customizing

If you're not familiar with YML files. YAML is a recursive acronym, so it stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language. It used to be called Yet Another Markup Language, but since it wasn't meant to create markup like HTML, the name got changed to the Weirder version.

YAML is meant to be converted to data, so they're like JSON files in that it will easily convert to JavaScript objects, but where whitespace is used instead of punctuation. It's also meant to be human readable. I think it's easy to read, but a little bit harder to define.

## Jobs

- labels/`name`
- `needs`
- `runs-on`
- `steps`

> > Author Notes:

Each jobs starts out with a label that separates it from other jobs. The rest of the information goes inside this label. It often begins witha name identifier for the job.

Jobs run in parallel, unless you ask one job to require another job to be finished, so you can use a needs attribute here to specify that dependency.

Next, you specify a runs-on parameter. Here you can select from different versions of Linux, Windows and mac Operating systems. You can even specify a matrix so the job runs on multiple platforms.

What follows is a series of steps. Each step is another series of tasks that let you use actions to do things.

## Steps Array

- `uses`/`run`
- `with`

> > Author Notes:

Steps are the sequence of tasks you want your jobs to perform. You can specify that the step uses a pre-written action or a Docker Container action.

There is a list of official pre-written [Github Actions](https://github.com/actions).

- You can specify some options that add information to the steps using the `with` attribute. and then passing along some data.
