- `runs-on`
- `steps`

> > Author Notes:

Each jobs starts out with a label that separates it from other jobs. The rest of the information goes inside this label. It often begins witha name identifier for the job.

Jobs run in parallel, unless you ask one job to require another job to be finished, so you can use a needs attribute here to specify that dependency.

Next, you specify a runs-on parameter. Here you can select from different versions of Linux, Windows and mac Operating systems. You can even specify a matrix so the job runs on multiple platforms.

What follows is a series of steps. Each step is another series of tasks that let you use actions to do things.

## Steps Array

- `uses`/`run`
- `with`

> > Author Notes:

Steps are the sequence of tasks you want your jobs to perform. You can specify that the step uses a pre-written action or a Docker Container action.

There is a list of official pre-written [Github Actions](https://github.com/actions).

- You can specify some options that add information to the steps using the `with` attribute. and then passing along some data.
